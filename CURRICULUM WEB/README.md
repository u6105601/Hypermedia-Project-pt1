Project Analysis

1. User Profile: The Recruiter

User Persona: "Anna Soler"

Role: Technical Recruiter at a video game development studio in Spain.

Age: 34

Objective: To quickly find promising junior talent for an internship or an entry-level developer or designer position.

Behavior: Anna reviews hundreds of portfolios every week. She spends an average of 30-60 seconds on her first pass of a resume website. She values clarity, professionalism, and demonstrated skills.

How My Website Helps Her:

Speed: The single-page architecture is perfect. She can get the full story simply by scrolling.

Clarity: The navigation bar (main-nav) acts as a "quick jump" menu. She can immediately click "MY SKILLS" or "EXPERIENCE" to jump to the sections she cares about most.

Personality: The "ABOUT ME" section is strategically placed near the top to build a personal connection, showing my hobbies and a photo that make me more memorable than just a name on a list.

2. Information Architecture

The site's information architecture (IA) is intentionally linear and narrative-driven, following the structure of a single-page application. I chose this design because it is ideal for a portfolio, as it guides the user (the recruiter) through a logical story without requiring them to click or get lost.

The structure is as follows:

Hero (presentation-hero): The "hook." It's the first impression, immediately answering "Who are you?" (Oriol Velasco Pereira) and "What do you do?" (Videogame Design Student). The 50/50 split between my professional photo and clear typography establishes a strong, immediate brand identity.

Navigation (main-nav): This serves as a "Table of Contents" for the rest of the page. 

Main Content (main): This area contains the central narrative, divided into logical sections that flow one after the other.

About Me (#about): I placed this section first to build a personal connection. It uses a symmetrical 3-column grid (info-image-info) to present my personal data.

My Skills (#skills): This is the functional core of my resume. It directly answers the recruiter's primary question: "What can you do?".

Work Experience (#experience): This section provides context and proof for the skills listed above.

Education (#education): This final content section provides the academic credentials that validate my skills and experience.

Footer (main-footer): This element signals the end of the page. It contains secondary links (Legal, Terms, etc.) and is visually distinct.

3. Visual Design

I based the visual design on minimalism, strong typography, and a elegant, coherent color palette. The goal is to create a site that feels professional, modern, and reliable.

Color Palette:
The design is based on three main colors:

Brown (#87766B): This is my primary brand color. It's a mature, grounded, and sophisticated color.

White (#FFFFFF): I use this as the background for the "light" sections.

Dark Gray (#3C3C3C): I use this for all text (titles and body). This is a key decision. Using a dark gray instead of pure black (#000000) is softer on the eyes and feels more professional.

Typography:
I used a powerful combination of two Google Fonts:

Krona One (Titles, Labels, UI): This is my main display font. I use it consistently for all h2 titles, labels (.info-label), and UI elements (.main-nav), creating a strong visual hierarchy.

Kotta One (Body Text): I use this serif font for all descriptive text (.description, .info-value).
